Trello Kanban coding task

Trello and Kanban with poulated tasks in the TODO, In progress and Done columns.

Pre populated with task in db.json file. Haven't implement an add feature or delete option.

Known bug for drag and drop - Not working on 1st drop everytime, new status is sent to the API
can refresh and see it displayed in the correct column, can also drag again and it will work
